        <p>
            In the local area incresing the amount of greenery can increase the albedo, or reflectivity index, of a local area, which can in turn reduce the local peak summer air temperatures by up to 3 degrees, in addition to increasing the thickness of the planetary boundary layer (where windspeeds are affected by ground friction) and thereby reduce windspeeds, lessening the impact of extreme weather events. The increase in vegetation cover can also be effective in increasing soil drainage and cohesion, thereby reducing the impact of flooding and landslides. The introduction of more plants can also allow them to better regulate the humidity of a given area, leading to a more pleasant environment to the average person. Albedo is reduced considerably further by increasing tree cover as opposed to increasing grass area and heavily manicured lawns are particularly bad at increasing this. Short version, more tree cover = cooler, less windy days with more pleasant humidity and less impact of severe weather events.

        <p>
            This one will be short and sweet. Increasing vegetation coverage means more plants sucking more carbon from the atmosphere to help balance our carbon emissions. more plants = more animals = more carbon stored in living things rather than having an impact on our atmosphere.
