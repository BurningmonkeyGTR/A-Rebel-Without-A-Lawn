            Increasing vegetation in our cities is proven to have a positive impact on mental health in the general population, it offers shade and natural rest areas for tired people, it reduces excessive air temperatures and is beneficial in many other ways.
            <br>
            <br>
            Tree cover and vegetation close to roads is proven to correlate with a reduction in road traffic accidents and in road speeds due to drivers perceiving them as more dangerous, in spite of statistical evidence to the contrary. this could be particularly useful in residential areas where children may be playing in the street or in city centres where there may be a large number of pedestrians.
            <br>
            <br>
            Spending time around larger amounts of vegetation and wildlife is proven to cause an increase in dopamine levels, which could help in addressing the wave of depression currently affecting developed nations worldwide. This could also have beneficial impacts in terms of encouraging people suffering from mild vitamin D deficiencies to spend more time outdoors, causing their bodies to increase vitamin D production.
            <br>
            <br>
            Allergic reactions have been linked to lack of exposure to the related allergen throughout childhood, therefore having children spend more time around increased amounts of vegetation in cities may cause a reduction in hayfever and in other plant related allergies.
            <br>
            <br>
            The lawn is a status symbol associated with wealth, and can be considered both a sign of and a contributor to wealth inequality, the latter due to the fact that in many areas a lawn is expensive to maintain and required by local government or homeowners assosiactions, therefore excluding people who may be able to afford the home only with a lower maintainence garden from being able to purchase these homes, thereby reducing social mobility. Lawns also require large amounts of water to maintain in hotter climates and often have large allowances made for them during water shortages, with lawns in higher income areas sometimes being allocated more water for their care than lower income areas are allocated in total.
