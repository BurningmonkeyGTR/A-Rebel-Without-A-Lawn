            Increasing vegetation cover and replacing lawns with more varied environments leads to an increase in viable habitats for many small animals, particularly when introducing wildflowers, bushes and shrubs. butterflies and other pollinators are more able to propogate due to having more sources of nectar in their range meaning we can make smaller investments into hand or automated pollination and leave it to the natural world more. large grassy areas also leave these pollinators and other small animals such as hedgehogs and shrews with much less cover to hide from predators in leading to severe over-predation and therefore a decline in their numbers, again leading to less pollination as well as an explosion in the numbers of the pests that hedgehogs and shrews eat and therefore more need for human intrevention. introducing trees also provides more habitats for squirrels, birds and other wildlife which can not only lead to an ecosystem which is capable of functioning much more independently of us, but also to greater biomass in the ecosystem and therefore a more effective carbon sink. the increase in vegetation can aso help to regulate humidity and allow a greater range of plants and animals to thrive.

            Now for the attack on lawns. they are one of the worst things to happen to our ecology in many years, heres a list of some of the reasons;
            <ul>
                <li>Lawns tend to need herbicides to keep them looking as owners generally want them to, these herbicides make the area unable to support greater biodiversity for sometimes years to come</li>
                <li>Pesticides are often used to keep lawns free of pests, but these often harm pollinators like bees and butterflies, and small mammals such as hedgehogs and squirrels in the process</li>
                <li>Lawns can create carbon emissions in excess of their potential as carbon sinks due to the use of fossil fuels in the production of fertilisers and in lawn care equipment</li>
                <li>Lawns require more water than similarly sized biomes with much greater biomass and biodiversity, which contributes to water shortages all over the world</li>
                <li>In many areas outside of Europe, lawn grasses are primarily non-native species and environments composed of them therefore support even less biodiversity</li>
                <li>In many areas around the world and particularly where lawns are common in the southern United States, lawns cannot survive without intense human intervention and therefore take excessive manpower, water, electricity and fossil fuels to maintain, all of which could be better used elsewhere</li>
            </ul>
