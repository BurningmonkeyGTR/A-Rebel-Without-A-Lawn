    <p>So you have a lawn? allow me to educate you on why that's not the best use of that space. Don't feel too bad, I'm going after big businesses and local government here too, since it seems like they don't understand why we need to increase the amount of greenery in all our residential and urban areas, and make it more diverse while we're at it.
        <br>
        <br>
    My proposal is to add more trees, bushes and shrubs to gardens and city centres across the country and the world, because more biomass means more carbon stored in living things and less in the atmosphere, more plants means lower surface temperatures in the local area and exposure to nature is proven to be beneficial to mental health, and more.
